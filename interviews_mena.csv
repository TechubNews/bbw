Simon Dixon,Simon Dixon,CEO & Co-Founder,CEO & Co-Founder,BnkToTheFuture.com,BnkToTheFuture.com,Simon Dixon 是资深金融专家，聚焦银行、货币改革和地缘金融，曾在投行担任股票经纪、做市商等，因家族在互联网泡沫损失惨重而转投货币变革。他是最早解读比特币制度和货币属性的投资人之一，著有《Bank to the Future》，并通过 BnkToTheFuture 平台促成了超 25 亿美金的行业投资。Simon 致力于普及比特币如何对抗央行数字货币和金融专制，被业界誉为“比特币投资银行家第一人”，其 YouTube/BTC 硬核访谈广受关注。,"Simon Dixon has always considered himself a finance geek—obsessed with banking, monetary reform and geo-financial analysis that shape our world. After building a career as an insider in investment banking—as a stockbroker, market maker, and corporate finance banker—he developed a rare understanding of how the financial system really works. But when his father lost everything in the dot-com bust, Simon left his lucrative career behind to become a monetary reformer, determined not just to expose the flaws of finance but to fix them.That mission led him to Bitcoin when it was just $3—a moment that changed everything. Unlike most early adopters who were tech enthusiasts, Simon came from finance, and he decoded what Satoshi left behind: Bitcoin was not just money, but the tool that could end the corrupt financial system, dismantle the Federal Reserve, and strip power from those who abuse it. He saw how politicians and regulators would deliberately co-opt innovation to maintain control—something he experienced first-hand when his attempts to reform the UK banking system were blocked.With that foresight, Simon gained financial freedom through Bitcoin and became one of the earliest investors in the industry’s biggest names—including Coinbase, Kraken, BitPay, Bitfinex, Blockchain.com, Circle and Robinhood. He is also the author of *Bank to the Future* (2012), the world’s first published book to ever discuss Bitcoin.Recognized by Robert Kiyosaki as “the first guy to ever talk about Bitcoin,” praised by Richard Branson for his investment platform BnkToTheFuture.com, and called by Max Keiser “the No.1 Bitcoin investment banker ever,” Simon has long been ahead of his time. Through BnkToTheFuture, he has facilitated over $2.5 billion of investments into companies that shaped the Bitcoin ecosystem.He has helped thousands become Bitcoin millionaires and billionaires—and now seeks to help millions more protect themselves, their families, and their nations from an AI-driven jobless future and the oppressive control of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)—with Bitcoin as the tool for freedom and protection.Simon is widely recognized not only for his pioneering role in Bitcoin but also for his expertise in geo-financial analysis, money, and investing. His ability to connect Bitcoin, macroeconomics, and global financial power shifts has allowed him to anticipate trends and events years before they unfold—making him the person many influencers and analysts quietly study.Through his weekly show BitcoinHardTalk (100k+ YouTube subscribers, 200k+ followers on X), Simon helps people follow the money, self-custody their Bitcoin, and resist an oppressive financial system whose time is running out.",你很早就从“货币改革”的视角拥抱比特币，目前在哪些国家或地区看到了这套逻辑真正开始落地？,"Coming from a monetary reform background, in which countries or regions do you now see bitcoin genuinely beginning to fulfill that reform thesis?",从你在 BnkToTheFuture 的投资实践看，比特币相关公司最容易在哪个阶段犯下“传统金融式”的错误？,"From your BnkToTheFuture investing experience, at which stage do bitcoin companies most often repeat the classic mistakes of traditional finance?",面向 Bitcoin MENA 2025 的观众，您认为未来三年比特币在中东地区最具突破性的应用会出现在何处？,"For the Bitcoin MENA 2025 audience, where do you see the most transformative applications of bitcoin emerging across the Middle East over the next three years?",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/687f979126432c8ce843e6d7/6900c3bd887c880bb611ed95_6a3dbaf2a45dea3799bd678e.webp,avatars/mena-speakers/simon-dixon.webp
