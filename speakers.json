    "biography": "Prof. Jacob (Yaqub) Hanna earned his BSc in medical science (2001), PhD in immunology (2007), and MD in clinical medicine summa cum laude (2007) from the Hebrew University. He conducted postdoctoral research at MIT. He joined the department of Molecular Genetics at the Weizmann Institute in 2011.Prof. Hanna is pioneering techniques in induced naïve pluripotency from adult cell and synthetic whole embryo-like developmental models made solely from stem cells ex utero for regenerating new organs and tissues. Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells have regenerative properties almost identical to those of embryonic stem cells but can be created from adult cells without using an egg or fetal material. Prof. Hanna has uncovered novel pathways regulating the reprogramming process and was the first to derive pristine “naïve” human pluripotent cells equivalent to those derived from mice and (i) can generate “cross-species humanized chimeric” mouse models that have human derived tissues (ii) can give rise to human primordial germ cell (progenitors of egg or sperm) or (iii) to all extra-embryonic compartments (placenta and yolk-sac). He was the first to expand prolonged periods of advanced and normal mammalian embryo development from pre-gastrulation until late organogenesis in an “artificial uterus” environment outside the maternal womb. The latter platform enabled him to demonstrate the ability to be the first to generate advanced stage & whole stem cell derived developmental models made entirely from naïve pluripotent stem cells in the petri dish in mice and human. He was awarded the Sir Charles Clore Prize (2011), a Rappaport Prize in biomedical research (2013), Krill Prize by the Wolf Foundation (2013), and the Helen and Martin Kimmel Award (2014). In 2014, he was featured among “40 under 40” innovative scientists by Cell journal and became EMBO member in 2018. In 2021, he ranked at the top of the list of 50 leading world thinkers by Prospect magazine. In 2025 he received the Nakasone award by the Human Frontiers Science Program for his groundbreaking work on naïve stem cell derived high fidelity embryo models.",
