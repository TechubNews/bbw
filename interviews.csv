Jacob Hanna,Jacob Hanna,Co-Founder and Chief Scientific Advisor,Co-Founder and Chief Scientific Advisor,RenewalBio INC.,RenewalBio INC.,Jacob（Yaqub）Hanna 教授于 2001 年在希伯来大学取得医学科学学士学位，2007 年获免疫学博士和临床医学博士（均为最高荣誉），随后在麻省理工学院从事博士后研究，并于 2011 年加入魏茨曼科学研究院分子遗传学系。Hanna 教授在成人细胞诱导幼稚多能性以及仅依靠干细胞在体外构建类整体胚胎发育模型方面处于世界领先地位。他揭示了重编程过程中的多条新通路，率先获得与小鼠等价的“原始型”人多能干细胞，这些细胞既可构建具有人体组织的跨物种嵌合小鼠模型，也可分化为人类原始生殖细胞（精子或卵子的前体），或形成包括胎盘和卵黄囊在内的全部胚外组织。他首次在“人工子宫”环境中，将哺乳动物胚胎从原肠胚形成前阶段在体外发育延长至晚期器官形成，并据此在培养皿中利用幼稚多能干细胞构建出高度逼真的小鼠和人类整体发育模型。他曾获 Sir Charles Clore 奖（2011）、Rappaport 生物医学研究奖（2013）、Wolf 基金会 Krill 奖（2013）和 Helen & Martin Kimmel 奖（2014），2014 年入选《Cell》“40 岁以下 40 位创新科学家”，2018 年成为 EMBO 会员，2021 年被《Prospect》杂志评为全球 50 位顶尖思想家之首，并于 2025 年因其在幼稚干细胞高保真胚胎模型方面的突破而获得人类前沿科学计划（HFSP）Nakasone 奖。,"Prof. Jacob (Yaqub) Hanna earned his BSc in medical science (2001), PhD in immunology (2007), and MD in clinical medicine summa cum laude (2007) from the Hebrew University. He conducted postdoctoral research at MIT. He joined the department of Molecular Genetics at the Weizmann Institute in 2011.Prof. Hanna is pioneering techniques in induced naïve pluripotency from adult cell and synthetic whole embryo-like developmental models made solely from stem cells ex utero for regenerating new organs and tissues. Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells have regenerative properties almost identical to those of embryonic stem cells but can be created from adult cells without using an egg or fetal material. Prof. Hanna has uncovered novel pathways regulating the reprogramming process and was the first to derive pristine “naïve” human pluripotent cells equivalent to those derived from mice and (i) can generate “cross-species humanized chimeric” mouse models that have human derived tissues (ii) can give rise to human primordial germ cell (progenitors of egg or sperm) or (iii) to all extra-embryonic compartments (placenta and yolk-sac). He was the first to expand prolonged periods of advanced and normal mammalian embryo development from pre-gastrulation until late organogenesis in an “artificial uterus” environment outside the maternal womb. The latter platform enabled him to demonstrate the ability to be the first to generate advanced stage & whole stem cell derived developmental models made entirely from naïve pluripotent stem cells in the petri dish in mice and human. He was awarded the Sir Charles Clore Prize (2011), a Rappaport Prize in biomedical research (2013), Krill Prize by the Wolf Foundation (2013), and the Helen and Martin Kimmel Award (2014). In 2014, he was featured among “40 under 40” innovative scientists by Cell journal and became EMBO member in 2018. In 2021, he ranked at the top of the list of 50 leading world thinkers by Prospect magazine. In 2025 he received the Nakasone award by the Human Frontiers Science Program for his groundbreaking work on naïve stem cell derived high fidelity embryo models.",Jacob Hanna，您在RenewalBio INC.担任Co-Founder and Chief Scientific Advisor期间，哪一个项目或战略最能体现您当前的关注点？能与我们分享背后的关键洞察吗？,"As the Co-Founder and Chief Scientific Advisor at RenewalBio INC., which recent project or strategy best captures your current focus, and what insights can you share from it?",你在干细胞与类胚胎模型上有突破性成果。作为科学家，你如何看待区块链和 DeSci 在科研数据共享与知识产权上的潜在作用？,"You’ve made groundbreaking advances in stem cells and embryo‑like models.
